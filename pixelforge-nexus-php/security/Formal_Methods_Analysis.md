# PixelForge Nexus - Formal Methods Analysis

## Overview

This document presents formal method specifications and analysis for critical security components of PixelForge Nexus. We apply lightweight formal methods including Finite State Machines (FSM), RBAC matrix validation, and invariant analysis to ensure system correctness and security.

## 1. Authentication Workflow - Finite State Machine (FSM)

### 1.1 FSM Definition

The authentication system can be modeled as a finite state machine with the following components:

**States (S):**
- `UNAUTHENTICATED` - Initial state, no valid session
- `CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED` - Username/password validated
- `MFA_PENDING` - Awaiting MFA token verification
- `AUTHENTICATED` - Full authentication complete
- `LOCKED` - Account locked due to security violations
- `EXPIRED` - Session expired, requires re-authentication

**Alphabet (Σ):**
- `login(username, password)` - Submit login credentials
- `mfa_verify(token)` - Submit MFA token
- `logout()` - Explicit logout
- `timeout()` - Session timeout
- `lock_account()` - Security violation triggers lock
- `unlock_account()` - Administrative unlock
- `failed_attempt()` - Failed login attempt

**Transition Function (δ):**

```
δ(UNAUTHENTICATED, login(valid_credentials)) = CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED
δ(UNAUTHENTICATED, login(invalid_credentials)) = UNAUTHENTICATED
δ(UNAUTHENTICATED, failed_attempt()) = UNAUTHENTICATED | LOCKED (after 5 attempts)

δ(CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED, mfa_verify(valid_token)) = AUTHENTICATED
δ(CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED, mfa_verify(invalid_token)) = CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED
δ(CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED, timeout()) = UNAUTHENTICATED

δ(AUTHENTICATED, logout()) = UNAUTHENTICATED
δ(AUTHENTICATED, timeout()) = EXPIRED
δ(AUTHENTICATED, lock_account()) = LOCKED

δ(LOCKED, unlock_account()) = UNAUTHENTICATED
δ(EXPIRED, login(valid_credentials)) = CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED
```

**Start State (q₀):** `UNAUTHENTICATED`

**Accept States (F):** `{AUTHENTICATED}`

### 1.2 FSM Properties and Invariants

**Safety Properties:**
1. **No Bypass**: ∀ transitions, cannot reach AUTHENTICATED without passing through CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED and MFA_PENDING
2. **Lock Enforcement**: Once in LOCKED state, only unlock_account() can transition out
3. **Session Integrity**: AUTHENTICATED state requires valid session token

**Liveness Properties:**
1. **Progress**: From any state, there exists a path to AUTHENTICATED (given valid credentials)
2. **Termination**: All authentication attempts eventually reach a terminal state

**Invariants:**
- `failed_attempts ≤ 5` (before account lock)
- `session_timeout ≤ MAX_SESSION_TIME`
- `mfa_token_expiry ≤ 300 seconds`

### 1.3 Formal Verification

**Theorem 1 (Authentication Completeness):**
```
∀ user with valid credentials and MFA token:
∃ path from UNAUTHENTICATED to AUTHENTICATED
```

**Proof:** By construction of transition function, valid credentials lead to CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED, and valid MFA token leads to AUTHENTICATED.

**Theorem 2 (Security Invariant):**
```
∀ states s ∈ S: 
(s = AUTHENTICATED) ⟹ (credentials_verified ∧ mfa_verified ∧ session_valid)
```

**Proof:** By FSM definition, AUTHENTICATED can only be reached after successful credential and MFA verification.

## 2. RBAC Matrix Model Validation

### 2.1 RBAC Model Definition

**Components:**
- **Users (U):** Set of all system users
- **Roles (R):** {super_admin, project_admin, developer, designer, qa_engineer, client, guest}
- **Permissions (P):** Set of all system permissions
- **Sessions (S):** Active user sessions
- **Objects (O):** System resources (projects, documents, prototypes, etc.)

**Relations:**
- **User Assignment (UA) ⊆ U × R:** Users assigned to roles
- **Permission Assignment (PA) ⊆ P × R:** Permissions assigned to roles
- **Session Users (session_users) ⊆ S × U:** Session to user mapping
- **Session Roles (session_roles) ⊆ S × R:** Active roles in session

### 2.2 RBAC Matrix

| Role | Permissions | Constraints |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| super_admin | ALL | System-wide access |
| project_admin | view_project, edit_project, manage_team, generate_reports | Project-scoped |
| developer | view_project, create_task, edit_task, upload_document | Project-scoped |
| designer | view_project, upload_document, submit_prototype | Project-scoped |
| qa_engineer | view_project, create_task, review_prototype | Project-scoped |
| client | view_project, view_document (approved only) | Project-scoped |
| guest | view_project (public only) | Limited access |

### 2.3 RBAC Formal Properties

**Core RBAC Properties:**

1. **Role Hierarchy Consistency:**
```
∀ r₁, r₂ ∈ R: r₁ ≥ r₂ ⟹ permissions(r₁) ⊇ permissions(r₂)
```

2. **Least Privilege:**
```
∀ u ∈ U, p ∈ P: can_access(u, p) ⟹ ∃ r ∈ roles(u): p ∈ permissions(r)
```

3. **Separation of Duties:**
```
∀ u ∈ U: ¬(has_role(u, admin) ∧ has_role(u, auditor))
```

4. **Dynamic Separation:**
```
∀ s ∈ S: |active_roles(s) ∩ conflicting_roles| ≤ 1
```

### 2.4 Access Control Invariants

**Project-Level Access Control:**
```
∀ user u, project p, permission perm:
can_access(u, p, perm) ⟺ 
  ∃ role r ∈ user_roles(u, p): perm ∈ role_permissions(r) ∧
  project_member(u, p) ∧
  role_active(u, r, p)
```

**Document Access Control:**
```
∀ user u, document d:
can_view(u, d) ⟺ 
  (can_access(u, d.project, 'view_document') ∧
   (d.visibility = 'public' ∨ 
    d.visibility = 'team' ∨
    (d.visibility = 'client' ∧ is_client(u)) ∨
    d.owner = u)) ∧
  ¬is_deleted(d)
```

## 3. Audit Logging Invariants

### 3.1 Audit Log Properties

**Completeness Invariant:**
```
∀ action a ∈ CRITICAL_ACTIONS:
  executed(a) ⟹ ∃ log_entry l: 
    l.action = a ∧ 
    l.timestamp = execution_time(a) ∧
    l.user = actor(a) ∧
    l.result = outcome(a)
```

**Integrity Invariant:**
```
∀ log_entry l ∈ AUDIT_LOG:
  immutable(l) ∧ 
  cryptographically_signed(l) ∧
  timestamp_verified(l)
```

**Non-Repudiation Invariant:**
```
∀ user u, action a:
  claims_not_performed(u, a) ∧ ∃ log_entry l: l.user = u ∧ l.action = a
  ⟹ can_prove_execution(a, u)
```

### 3.2 Audit Trail Formal Specification

**Audit Event Structure:**
```
AuditEvent = {
  id: EventID,
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  user: UserID,
  action: ActionType,
  object: ObjectID,
  result: {SUCCESS, FAILURE},
  metadata: JSON,
  signature: CryptographicSignature
}
```

**Audit Trail Properties:**
1. **Ordering:** Events are totally ordered by timestamp
2. **Completeness:** All security-relevant actions are logged
3. **Integrity:** Log entries cannot be modified after creation
4. **Availability:** Audit logs are always accessible to authorized users

## 4. Export Rate Limiting - Timed Automata

### 4.1 Timed Automata Model

**Clock Variables:**
- `x`: Time since last export request
- `y`: Time in current rate limiting window

**Locations:**
- `READY`: Can accept export requests
- `RATE_LIMITED`: Too many requests, must wait
- `PROCESSING`: Export in progress

**Transitions:**
```
READY --[request ∧ x ≥ MIN_INTERVAL]--> PROCESSING
READY --[request ∧ x < MIN_INTERVAL]--> RATE_LIMITED
PROCESSING --[complete]--> READY {x := 0}
RATE_LIMITED --[y ≥ RATE_WINDOW]--> READY {y := 0}
```

**Invariants:**
- `READY: x ≤ MAX_WAIT`
- `RATE_LIMITED: y ≤ RATE_WINDOW`
- `PROCESSING: x ≤ MAX_PROCESSING_TIME`

### 4.2 Rate Limiting Properties

**Safety Property:**
```
∀ time_window w: exports_in_window(w) ≤ MAX_EXPORTS_PER_WINDOW
```

**Liveness Property:**
```
∀ valid_request r: eventually_processed(r) ∨ explicitly_rejected(r)
```

## 5. File Upload Security Model

### 5.1 File Validation State Machine

**States:**
- `UPLOADED`: File received from client
- `VALIDATED`: File type and size validated
- `SCANNED`: Virus/malware scan complete
- `STORED`: File safely stored in system
- `REJECTED`: File rejected due to security concerns

**Validation Rules:**
```
validate_file(file) = {
  check_file_type(file) ∧
  check_file_size(file) ∧
  check_file_content(file) ∧
  virus_scan(file) ∧
  check_permissions(user, upload_location)
}
```

**Security Invariants:**
1. **Type Safety:** Only whitelisted file types are accepted
2. **Size Limits:** File size ≤ MAX_FILE_SIZE
3. **Content Validation:** File content matches declared type
4. **Isolation:** Uploaded files are stored in sandboxed location

## 6. Correctness Claims and Verification

### 6.1 System-Level Security Properties

**Authentication Security:**
- **Claim:** No user can access the system without proper authentication
- **Verification:** FSM analysis shows all paths to AUTHENTICATED require credential and MFA verification

**Authorization Security:**
