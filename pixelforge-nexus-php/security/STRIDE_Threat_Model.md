# PixelForge Nexus - STRIDE Threat Model Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive threat analysis of PixelForge Nexus using the STRIDE methodology. STRIDE is a threat modeling framework that categorizes threats into six types: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

## System Overview

PixelForge Nexus is a secure game development project management system featuring:
- Multi-factor authentication with RBAC
- Document and asset management
- Prototype and video submission workflows
- Comprehensive audit logging and reporting
- Role-based access control with 7 distinct roles
